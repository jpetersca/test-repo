## 1. INDUSTRY CONTEXT / THE STAKES

**In hospitality, operational friction is immediately visible to guests—and directly impacts your brand reputation and revenue.**

Whether you're managing luxury hotels, franchise restaurant locations, or travel services, your brand promise depends on consistent execution across dozens or hundreds of properties. A broken HVAC system in a hotel room. A delay in kitchen equipment repair. An IT issue that prevents check-in. A facility problem that impacts the guest experience. Each represents both a service recovery opportunity and a potential negative review that reaches thousands of prospective customers.

Yet most hospitality operators manage these challenges with fragmented systems: property management calls facilities directly, IT requests go through email, guest issues get escalated via phone trees, and corporate headquarters lacks real-time visibility into what's happening across properties. General managers spend hours coordinating responses to operational issues rather than focusing on guest satisfaction and team development.

The competitive stakes are high. Guests notice when operations are seamless—and they definitely notice when they're not. Properties with faster issue resolution see higher satisfaction scores, better online reviews, and stronger repeat business. In an industry where reputation is everything and margins are tight, operational excellence isn't optional—it's the foundation of brand differentiation.

## 2. THE CORE CHALLENGES

Hospitality operations leaders face unique pressures that multiply across properties:

### 🏨 Fragmented Property Operations Management
Property-level teams manage dozens of operational needs daily—guest room maintenance, public space facilities, kitchen equipment, IT systems, supply chain, housekeeping coordination—across disconnected systems. There's no unified way to submit, track, or resolve requests, leading to delays that directly impact guest experience.

### 🔧 Slow Issue Resolution Impacting Guest Experience
When something breaks—HVAC, wifi, kitchen equipment, elevators—the speed of resolution directly impacts guest satisfaction and revenue. But traditional service request processes involve phone calls, emails, and manual coordination. Issues that should take hours take days. Guests notice. Reviews suffer.

### 🏢 Disconnected Corporate, Regional, and Property Teams
Corporate headquarters sets brand standards and operational policies, but lacks real-time visibility into how properties are performing. Regional teams coordinate between corporate and properties but lack tools for effective oversight. Property teams feel unsupported. The result is inconsistent execution and brand standards that exist on paper but not in practice.

### 👨‍🍳 Frontline Staff Productivity and Retention
Hospitality staff turnover is notoriously high, and operational complexity makes it worse. When frontline workers spend excessive time navigating broken processes to get basic things done, productivity suffers and burnout accelerates. The best employees leave for brands that make their jobs easier.

### ⭐ Inability to Deliver Consistent Brand Experiences
Guests choose hospitality brands based on expectations of consistent quality. But when operational processes vary by property, franchisees operate on different systems, or corporate standards aren't enforced systematically, consistency breaks down. Brand value erodes.

## 3. YOUR POINT OF VIEW / THESIS

**The answer isn't more hospitality technology. It's an intelligent operations platform that connects every property, every department, and every service request into a unified system.**

Most hospitality brands have accumulated technology over time—one system for property management, another for facility maintenance, a third for IT support, separate platforms for guest services and supply chain. Each made sense at the time, but together they create operational friction rather than reducing it. Property teams still need to know which system to use for which issue, and coordination requires phone calls and emails.

This is where ServiceNow for Hospitality transforms operations. Instead of multiple disconnected systems, you create a single intelligent interface where property teams submit any operational request—facility, IT, supply chain, guest services, HR—and AI-powered workflows route, coordinate, and track resolution automatically. Instead of regional teams operating blind, they have real-time dashboards showing operational health across all properties. Instead of corporate headquarters hoping brand standards are met, they have workflows that ensure consistent execution.

**We believe hospitality operations should work like this:**
- **Property teams** access a single, intelligent self-service interface for any operational need, with AI routing requests to the right team and tracking resolution
- **Frontline staff** get issues resolved quickly without navigating complex processes, so they can focus on creating memorable guest experiences
- **Regional teams** work from unified dashboards with complete visibility into property performance and operational metrics
- **Corporate headquarters** has real-time insight into brand standard compliance, with automated workflows ensuring consistency across corporate and franchise properties
- **Franchise partners** operate on the same platform as corporate properties, with appropriate access controls and pricing models that make adoption viable

The shift from "fragmented by property" to "unified by brand" enables the operational excellence that great hospitality experiences require. And it starts with the right ServiceNow implementation strategy, whether you're deploying Customer Service Management, Field Service Management, or integrated operations platforms.
