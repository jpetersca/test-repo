## 1. INDUSTRY CONTEXT / THE STAKES

**Healthcare workers spend 34% of their time on administrative tasks.**

The promise of healthcare technology was to make care delivery more efficient, more responsive, more human. Instead, most health systems are running on a patchwork of manual processes and disconnected systems that create friction at every turn. Care teams wait on hold for support. Agents toggle between screens to connect the dots. Critical services—biomed, facilities, pharmacy, lab—operate in silos, tied together by human middleware.

The cost isn't just operational. It's burnout. It's delay. It's the erosion of what drew talented clinicians into healthcare in the first place. And as patient volumes grow and staffing remains constrained, the gap between expectation and reality widens.

---

## 2. THE CORE CHALLENGES

Healthcare operations teams face a common set of pressures that compound over time:

### 📋 Manual, Fragmented Workflows
Care teams navigate multiple systems to resolve routine requests—supply orders, equipment issues, facility concerns. Each requires phone calls, emails, or trips to a whiteboard. The promise of "self-service" hasn't materialized because the underlying processes aren't actually automated.

### 🔄 Low Self-Service Adoption & Automation
Most healthcare organizations have portals, but low utilization. Why? Because self-service that still requires human intervention on the back end isn't really self-service. True automation—where a request flows through to resolution without human touchpoints—remains rare.

### 🖥️ Agent Inefficiency Across Multiple Systems
Care agents juggle disparate applications—ITSM, biomed management, facilities tracking, supply chain tools. There's no unified view. Time is wasted switching contexts, searching for information, and manually coordinating across teams.

### 📊 Impact on Critical KPIs
The result is visible in the metrics that matter: mean-time-to-resolution creeps up, care team burnout accelerates, incident volume stays high, and wait times frustrate everyone. The status quo isn't sustainable.

## 3. YOUR POINT OF VIEW / THESIS

**The answer isn't more technology. It's smarter orchestration of the technology you already have.**

Most healthcare IT initiatives add another layer—another app, another portal, another dashboard. What's needed is integration and intelligence: a way to connect your existing systems, surface the right information at the right moment, and automate the routine so humans can focus on the complex.

This is where ServiceNow Healthcare Operations—combined with modern agentic AI—changes the equation. Instead of care teams navigating systems, the systems navigate themselves. Instead of agents stitching together information manually, AI orchestrates workflows across biomed, facilities, pharmacy, radiology, and beyond. Instead of support services reacting to requests one by one, intelligent automation resolves entire categories of issues without human intervention.

**We believe healthcare operations should work like this:**
- **Care teams** self-serve on routine requests, with AI handling the back-end orchestration in real time.
- **Care agents** work from a unified desktop, with AI surfacing context and next-best actions, regardless of which underlying system holds the data.
- **Support services** operate proactively, with workflows that anticipate needs, route intelligently, and resolve autonomously wherever possible.

The shift from "manual by default" to "automated by design" isn't theoretical. It's happening now, at leading health systems. And it starts with a clear-eyed assessment of where your bottlenecks are, what's truly possible with your existing ServiceNow footprint, and how to deploy agentic AI in a way that accelerates time to value rather than adding complexity.
