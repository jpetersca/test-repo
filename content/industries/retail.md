## 1. INDUSTRY CONTEXT / THE STAKES

**Frontline retail workers spend hours each day navigating disconnected systems to resolve routine operational issues—time that could be spent serving customers.**

The modern retail environment demands operational excellence at scale. Whether you're managing corporate-owned locations, franchise partners, or a hybrid model, your teams need to coordinate seamlessly across store operations, supply chain, facilities, IT, and customer service. Yet most retailers are running on fragmented technology stacks where store managers submit requests via email, regional teams lack visibility into operational metrics, and headquarters struggles to maintain consistency across locations.

The cost shows up in multiple ways: Lost sales when equipment breaks and repairs take days instead of hours. Employee frustration when simple requests require multiple phone calls and follow-ups. Inconsistent customer experiences when processes vary by location. And competitive disadvantage when faster-moving retailers deliver better omnichannel experiences with leaner operations.

The gap between customer expectations and operational reality is widening—and retailers who can't execute consistently across all touchpoints will lose ground to those who can.

## 2. THE CORE CHALLENGES

Retail operations leaders face interconnected pressures that compound across locations:

### 🏪 Fragmented Store Operations Management
Store managers and associates handle dozens of daily operational tasks—facility issues, equipment repairs, supply requests, IT problems, scheduling conflicts—across disconnected systems. There's no unified interface for submitting, tracking, or resolving requests, leading to delays and workarounds.

### 📞 Inefficient Service Request Management
When something breaks or goes wrong, store teams resort to phone calls, emails, or spreadsheets to get help. Regional support teams lack visibility into request volume and status. Issues get lost in the shuffle. Resolution times stretch unnecessarily.

### 🔌 Disconnected Headquarters, Stores, and Regional Teams
Headquarters sets policies and standards, but lacks real-time visibility into how stores are executing. Regional teams operate as intermediaries but don't have tools to coordinate effectively. Stores feel disconnected from corporate support. The result is inconsistent execution and frustrated teams at every level.

### 👥 Poor Employee Experience and Productivity
Frontline workers spend excessive time navigating operational friction instead of serving customers. When basic tasks require complex workarounds, productivity suffers and turnover accelerates. The promise of technology-enabled retail hasn't materialized for the workers who need it most.

### 🛒 Inability to Deliver Seamless Omnichannel Experiences
Customers expect consistent service whether they're shopping in-store, online, via mobile, or through buy-online-pickup-in-store. But when backend operations are fragmented, creating seamless omnichannel experiences becomes nearly impossible.

## 3. YOUR POINT OF VIEW / THESIS

**The answer isn't more point solutions. It's an intelligent automation platform that connects every part of retail operations into a unified system.**

Most retailers have invested in best-of-breed tools—one system for facility management, another for IT service management, a third for supply chain, and separate platforms for customer service. Each works reasonably well in isolation, but they don't talk to each other. Store teams still need to know which system to use for which request, and coordination across systems requires manual effort.

This is where ServiceNow for Retail transforms operations. Instead of multiple disconnected platforms, you create a single intelligent interface where store teams submit any request—facility, IT, supply chain, HR—and AI-powered workflows route, orchestrate, and resolve requests automatically. Instead of regional teams playing phone tag, they work from a unified desktop with complete visibility. Instead of headquarters guessing at operational health, they have real-time dashboards showing performance across all locations.

**We believe retail operations should work like this:**
- **Store teams** access a single, intelligent self-service interface for any operational need, with AI handling routing and orchestration behind the scenes
- **Regional and support teams** work from unified desktops that surface relevant information regardless of which backend system holds it
- **Headquarters** has real-time visibility into operational metrics, with workflows that ensure consistent execution of corporate standards across all locations
- **Franchise partners** operate on the same platform as corporate stores, with appropriate access controls and per-store pricing models that make adoption economically viable

The shift from "fragmented by function" to "unified by workflow" isn't just about technology—it's about enabling the operational excellence that great retail experiences require. And it starts with the right ServiceNow implementation strategy, whether you're deploying Retail Service Management, Store Operations, Field Service Management, or a combination.
