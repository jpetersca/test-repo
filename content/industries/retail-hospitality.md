## 1. INDUSTRY CONTEXT / THE STAKES

**Frontline workers in retail and hospitality spend hours navigating disconnected systems—time that should be spent creating exceptional customer experiences.**

Success in retail and hospitality depends on consistent execution across dozens, hundreds, or thousands of locations. A broken HVAC system. Equipment repairs that take days instead of hours. IT issues that prevent transactions. Supply chain delays. Each operational hiccup directly impacts customer experience, employee satisfaction, and ultimately, revenue.

Yet most organizations manage these challenges with fragmented systems: store managers submit facility requests via email, hotel properties call IT support directly, regional teams lack visibility into operational metrics, and corporate headquarters struggles to ensure brand standards are consistently met. General managers and store leaders spend excessive time coordinating responses rather than focusing on customers and team development.

The competitive stakes are high. Customers notice when operations are seamless—and they definitely notice when they're not. In industries where experience is everything, online reviews reach thousands instantly, and margins remain tight, operational excellence isn't optional. It's the foundation of brand differentiation and the key to retaining both customers and frontline talent in tight labor markets.

## 2. THE CORE CHALLENGES

Retail and hospitality operations leaders face interconnected pressures that multiply across locations:

### 🏪 Fragmented Operations Management Across Locations
Store managers and property teams juggle dozens of operational needs daily—facility maintenance, equipment repairs, IT issues, supply requests, scheduling—across disconnected systems. There's no unified way to submit, track, or resolve requests. Issues get lost. Resolution times stretch. Customers feel the impact.

### 🔧 Slow Issue Resolution Impacting Customer Experience
When something breaks—point-of-sale systems, kitchen equipment, HVAC, wifi, elevators—speed of resolution directly impacts sales and satisfaction. Traditional service request processes involve phone calls, emails, and manual coordination. What should take hours takes days. Lost revenue adds up. Reviews suffer. Competitors gain ground.

### 🏢 Disconnected Corporate, Regional, and Location Teams
Corporate headquarters sets brand standards and policies, but lacks real-time visibility into how locations are performing. Regional teams coordinate between corporate and the field but don't have tools for effective oversight. Location teams feel unsupported. The result is inconsistent execution and brand standards that exist on paper but not in practice.

### 👥 Frontline Staff Productivity and Retention
Retail and hospitality turnover is notoriously high, and operational complexity makes it worse. When frontline workers spend excessive time navigating broken processes to accomplish basic tasks, productivity suffers and burnout accelerates. Your best employees leave for brands that make their jobs easier.

### ⭐ Inability to Deliver Consistent Brand Experiences
Customers choose brands based on expectations of consistent quality—whether shopping across store locations or staying at different properties in a hotel portfolio. But when operational processes vary by location, franchisees operate on different systems, or corporate standards aren't systematically enforced, consistency breaks down. Brand value erodes.

## 3. YOUR POINT OF VIEW / THESIS

**The answer isn't more point solutions. It's an intelligent automation platform that connects every location, every department, and every operational need into a unified system.**

Most retail and hospitality brands have accumulated technology over time—one system for facility management, another for IT support, a third for supply chain, separate platforms for customer service. Each made sense individually, but together they create friction rather than eliminating it. Location teams still need to know which system to use for which issue, and coordination requires phone calls and manual effort.

This is where ServiceNow for Retail and Hospitality transforms operations. Instead of multiple disconnected platforms, you create a single intelligent interface where location teams submit any operational request—facility, IT, supply chain, guest services, HR—and AI-powered workflows automatically route, orchestrate, and track resolution. Instead of regional teams operating blind, they have real-time dashboards showing operational health across all locations. Instead of headquarters hoping standards are met, they have workflows that ensure consistent execution.

**We believe retail and hospitality operations should work like this:**
- **Location teams** access a single, intelligent self-service interface for any operational need, with AI handling routing and orchestration behind the scenes
- **Frontline staff** get issues resolved quickly without navigating complex processes, so they can focus on creating memorable customer experiences
- **Regional and support teams** work from unified desktops that surface relevant information regardless of which backend system holds it
- **Corporate headquarters** has real-time visibility into operational metrics and brand standard compliance, with automated workflows ensuring consistency across all locations
- **Franchise partners** operate on the same platform as corporate locations, with appropriate access controls and per-location pricing models that make adoption economically viable

The shift from "fragmented by function" to "unified by workflow" enables the operational excellence that great retail and hospitality experiences require. And it starts with the right ServiceNow implementation strategy—whether you're deploying Customer Service Management, Field Service Management, Retail Service Management, or integrated operations platforms.
