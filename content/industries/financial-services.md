## 1. INDUSTRY CONTEXT / THE STAKES

**70% of financial institutions must demonstrate compliance across at least 4 frameworks spanning security and data privacy taxonomies.**

No matter where you operate, banking regulations are becoming increasingly complex—and banks can only go as fast as they can regulate. From GLBA and SOX in the Americas to DORA and PSD2 in EMEA, to Basel III and operational resilience requirements globally, the regulatory landscape demands unprecedented coordination across risk, compliance, and operational teams.

The cost of getting it wrong is steep: fines exceeding $1M, damaged customer trust, and regulatory scrutiny that can constrain business growth for years. Yet most banks are trying to manage this complexity with siloed data, disconnected teams, and antiquated tools that make real-time visibility impossible. Compliance officers spend 1-2 hours per week just tracking regulatory developments—time that could be spent on strategic risk management. The status quo isn't sustainable.

## 2. THE CORE CHALLENGES

Financial institutions face a common set of pressures that make integrated risk and compliance management increasingly difficult:

### 🗂️ Siloed Data and Disconnected Teams
Risk data lives in disparate systems across the organization. Compliance teams work independently from risk teams. Audit functions operate in parallel. The result is inaccurate, missing, or incomplete data that makes holistic risk assessment nearly impossible.

### 📊 Manual, Unreliable Risk Reporting
Risk reporting still relies on manual Excel-based processes where teams compile data from multiple sources into reports. This creates bottlenecks, introduces errors, and prevents leadership from having real-time visibility into enterprise risk exposure.

### 📜 Increasing Regulatory Complexity
46% of risk and compliance professionals cite increasing regulations as the primary driver of workload. From AML and operational resilience to AI governance and consumer duty requirements, staying current requires constant monitoring and adaptation across multiple frameworks.

### ⚠️ Operational Inefficiency and Cross-Department Friction
Without a unified taxonomy and standardized processes, non-risk technical roles spend significant time supporting risk-related activities. Compliance officers spend 45% of their time just implementing controls rather than strategic risk management. Only 41% of Chief Risk Officers have established a cloud risk management plan in the last two years.

## 3. YOUR POINT OF VIEW / THESIS

**The answer isn't more compliance software. It's integrated governance that connects risk, compliance, and operational data into a single system of record.**

Most financial institutions have invested heavily in GRC tools, but they've built in silos—one system for operational risk, another for compliance management, a third for internal audit, and legacy tools for specific regulatory requirements. What's missing is integration: a unified view that connects risk events to controls, controls to regulatory obligations, and obligations to evidence.

This is where ServiceNow Integrated Risk Management (IRM) and GRC capabilities transform the compliance function. Instead of manually compiling risk data for board reports, the system aggregates and normalizes data automatically. Instead of chasing down control evidence across departments, workflows orchestrate collection and validation. Instead of reacting to regulatory changes with ad-hoc assessments, you build a taxonomy and framework that adapts as requirements evolve.

**We believe financial services risk and compliance should work like this:**
- **A single source of truth** for risk data, with standardized taxonomy across the enterprise that eliminates conflicting information
- **Automated control testing and evidence collection** that reduces manual effort and provides continuous assurance rather than point-in-time snapshots
- **Real-time risk visibility** for executives, with dashboards that connect operational metrics to strategic risk appetite
- **Responsive frameworks** that adapt to new regulations without requiring system rebuilds or process overhauls

The shift from "compliance as cost center" to "risk as strategic enabler" requires more than technology—it requires a clear transformation roadmap aligned to your regulatory mandates. TQStarling specializes in helping financial institutions modernize their ServiceNow GRC and IRM platforms to create that foundation.
