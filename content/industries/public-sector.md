## 1. INDUSTRY CONTEXT / THE STAKES

**Citizens interact with government services expecting the same seamless digital experience they get from private sector companies—but most agencies aren't equipped to deliver.**

The public sector is facing a transformation imperative. Constituents expect to renew licenses, apply for permits, request services, and get answers online—without phone calls, office visits, or paperwork. Employees expect modern tools that make their jobs easier, not harder. And elected officials demand measurable results: faster service delivery, improved satisfaction scores, and better use of taxpayer dollars.

Yet most government agencies operate on decades-old technology infrastructure. Departments function in silos with their own systems. Case management happens through email and spreadsheets. Citizens call multiple numbers to get answers. Knowledge lives in individual employees' heads rather than searchable systems. IT backlogs stretch for months. And workforce turnover threatens to take institutional knowledge out the door.

The stakes go beyond operational efficiency. Public trust in government depends on the ability to deliver services effectively. When residents can't get timely answers, permits take months instead of weeks, or critical services are difficult to access, frustration builds. Meanwhile, neighboring jurisdictions that have modernized their operations are delivering better experiences with fewer resources—creating competitive pressure even in the public sector.

## 2. THE CORE CHALLENGES

Public sector leaders face a distinct set of pressures that compound across departments and jurisdictions:

### 🏛️ Legacy Systems and Technical Debt
Decades of technology investments have created a complex landscape of disconnected systems—many running on outdated platforms that are expensive to maintain, difficult to integrate, and impossible to extend. Modernization efforts stall because replacing these systems feels overwhelming and risky.

### 🗂️ Siloed Departments and Fragmented Data
Each department operates independently with its own systems, processes, and data. When a constituent request requires coordination across departments—building permits that involve planning, zoning, and inspections—manual handoffs create delays and confusion. No one has a unified view of citizen interactions.

### 📞 Manual, Paper-Based Processes
Despite modernization efforts, many government services still rely on phone calls, in-person visits, and paper forms. Citizens can't track request status. Staff manually enter information from one system to another. Case resolution takes weeks because there's no workflow automation. Productivity suffers.

### 👨‍💼 Workforce Challenges and Knowledge Loss
Public sector employees are aging out of the workforce, taking decades of institutional knowledge with them. New hires expect modern technology, not legacy green-screen terminals. Without knowledge management systems and process automation, agencies risk losing critical expertise and struggling to onboard replacements.

### 📊 Lack of Visibility and Performance Measurement
Leadership teams lack real-time dashboards showing service performance, case volumes, resolution times, and citizen satisfaction. Reporting requires manual data compilation. Without visibility into operational metrics, it's impossible to identify bottlenecks, allocate resources effectively, or demonstrate accountability to elected officials and constituents.

### 💰 Budget Constraints and "Do More with Less" Mandates
Public sector budgets are perpetually constrained, and agencies face pressure to deliver more services with flat or declining resources. Traditional modernization approaches—large-scale custom development or system replacements—are financially and politically difficult. Agencies need solutions that deliver value incrementally and prove ROI quickly.

## 3. YOUR POINT OF VIEW / THESIS

**The answer isn't wholesale system replacement. It's a modern digital platform that orchestrates across your existing systems and incrementally delivers citizen-facing and operational improvements.**

Most government modernization initiatives start with a fundamental mistake: attempting to replace everything at once. The reality is that many legacy systems need to stay—they contain decades of data, support critical functions, and replacing them is prohibitively expensive and risky. What's needed isn't replacement, it's intelligent orchestration: a modern platform layer that connects existing systems, automates workflows, and provides unified interfaces for both citizens and employees.

This is where ServiceNow for Government transforms operations. Instead of ripping out legacy systems, you create a digital front door that citizens use to request any service—and behind the scenes, ServiceNow orchestrates workflows across your existing systems. Instead of employees toggling between applications, they work from a unified agent desktop that surfaces information regardless of where it lives. Instead of manual handoffs between departments, automated workflows route cases intelligently and track progress end-to-end.

**We believe government operations should work like this:**
- **Citizens** access a single digital portal for any government service, with the ability to submit requests, track status, and get answers 24/7 without phone calls or office visits
- **Employees** work from unified case management interfaces that orchestrate workflows across departments and backend systems, eliminating manual coordination
- **Departments** share a common platform with standardized processes while maintaining appropriate autonomy and security controls
- **Leadership** has real-time dashboards showing service performance, citizen satisfaction, and operational efficiency—enabling data-driven decisions
- **IT teams** can extend and improve services through low-code/no-code tools rather than lengthy custom development projects

The shift from "siloed by department" to "unified by citizen need" is not just about technology—it's about transforming how government delivers value. And it happens incrementally: start with high-impact citizen services, prove value, then expand to additional departments and use cases.

TQStarling specializes in helping government agencies navigate this transformation—from initial use case selection through implementation, change management, and scaling across the organization.
